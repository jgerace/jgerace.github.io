Here are a few projects I've authored over the years. Hopefully someone can find them useful or educational.

## [Dexter](https://github.com/jgerace/dexter)

The self-hosted app that helps you remember your acquaintances and avoid awkward conversational moments!

## [PDFMerge](https://github.com/jgerace/pdfmerge)

Too cheap to pay for Acrobat Reader? Too security-minded to upload your files to a random PDF merging webapp? Too lazy to download a full-featured PDF editor? Combine your PDF documents in a single terminal command!

## [SMSBackup](https://github.com/jgerace/SMSBackup)

An Android app to back up text messages from my old Samsung Galaxy S7.
