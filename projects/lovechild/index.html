    Have you ever wondered what it would be like if "Goblin Market" walked into a club and started spittin' some game at "Leaves of Grass" and was almost cockblocked by "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" except Rime was distracted by Goblin's kickass wingman, "Aurora Leigh," giving Goblin the chance to get to know Leaves and even though Leaves said she wasn't really looking to go home with anyone that evening, Goblin was actually pretty charming so Leaves figured "What the hell?" and threw all caution to the wind, which ended up being a really bad idea because Leaves totally got irresponsible and found herself a few months later all knocked up?

    Now we can all find out! Pick two poets (or be boring and pick the same one twice, I don't care) and receive a randomly-generated poem (set of words, really...mostly nonsense) in the combined style of both of them.
