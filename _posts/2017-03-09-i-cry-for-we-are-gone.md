I am the storms lapping  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upon naves,<!--more-->  
  
the heart's loss  
wrote in the mist.  
  
She never quit making  
an enemy of the sunset,  
of the dead,  
the poor, millionaire manners and heartbeats of old men.  
  
Drop by drop by drop  
red glut.  
  
Peach blue eyes,  
a face of high poem  
break the harvest moon.  
  
The lucky in shanties to-night shoulders nuzzled  
rebuilt in the universal fiber  
into death.  
  
Glories and flowers and sorrow,  
let them to dust and fire and rain.  
I am deaf to a hundred sunset embers.  
  
I know how much you know to-night.
