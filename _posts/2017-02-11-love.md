Love is this: you--  
a dark-faced feeliness.  
It is the pavement  
quarreling with stars.<!--more-->
  
Love is a lice  
into the grief, truth:  
I take of the tips delicious!  
The flowers  
the great good grass  
all are laced up.
  
My love is a simple disc  
in spite of god.  
How the birch leadeth  
to love that old  
astonished sun-blur.
  
O criss-cross oozy swamplight of snow drink  
of cities, of rain-light  
circled to every high face  
on the alders, the great rain.  
Let us wonder, take the secret mind  
that stretches my house,  
the world.
