I see through all the growing and the brooks and  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the moonlight of wharves.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every grain speaks  
and the stars.<!--more-->  
  
I see the mechanically wounded  
rise from the ranks, and embrace!  
  
I understand you;  
  
I remember you,  
the sick eyes of the singing earth,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;falling for the land,  
of the tender fools shrieking softly  
and the city! where live a great  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;many more foolish humans.  
  
I see the gentle easternly pines!  
against horizons purple,  
slow-flapping.  
  
You are the sea laughing  
broken with me, whole, silent.  
  
My dead life,  
a lonelines so plenteous, murmuring,  
raising ships and red river bunches.  
  
I, wild-cat,  
I do not seek beautiful body, anger, war,  
thin curve of reveries  
  
I would trade sight to escape the brick-shaped  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reckless hum,  
the ebb of time  
conqueror yet.
