&nbsp;&nbsp;She no more swept the house,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should see her again.  
And wait awhile for the corpse's smile<!--more-->  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Prefer to glean with Ruth?  
And when I sought my bed,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all the world grows dim;  
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Harrowed and hideous in a filthy lair,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;So the fading phantoms flee,  
She gave a ring to me  
  
&nbsp;Just as before you went below;  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were common beasts and rare,  
No voice to call the sleepers,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Before whose face I no more bow my head  
Seeds, and roots, and stones of fruits,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the bygone be:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wrenched piecemeal or devoured or set on flame,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;My harvest dwindled to a husk.
