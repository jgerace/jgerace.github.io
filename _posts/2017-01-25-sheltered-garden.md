I see another life  
a hill,  
burned or start, wondered at leased.<!--more-->  
  
And sounds.  
Where you graded--a safe crust  
spilled in these  
nereids  
but the leaf is rend open the honey of your ragged from its flower,  
I climbed the kiss of mint,  
the straight any mouth  
I write violets,  
we are left--  
ankle.
